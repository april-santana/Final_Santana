  					<h1>The First Wave's Effects on New York Hospitals</h1>
    				<p class="lead"> Hospitals experienced a surge of cases at the start of the pandemic. New York state was hit the worst by the first wave and many hospitals were overwhelmed. The age demographic of 65 and older made up the majority of hospitalizations. Many counties - New York and Nassau - had a surplus in patients. </p>

					<h2> New York in the early stages of Covid </h2>
					<p>The months of March and April of 2020 led to an influx in hospitalizations for many New York hospitals. In early March, New York state was seeing <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/23/new-york-coronavirus-cases-surge-38percent-overnight-to-20875.html" target="_blank">38% surges overnight</a>, CNBC reported.  New York State was reporting more cases than both South Korea and France. By April 2020, the state was working towards <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/04/16/coronavirus-new-york-city-hospitals-plateau/2992258001/" target="_blank">flattening the surge</a> of cases in many New York City boroughs.  </p>
					<p>New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut - the three states hit the worst by the first wave - were experiencing large numbers of covid deaths five weeks into the pandemic. The first week of April 2020, the region’s one-day toll topped 1,000 - the <a href=" https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/nyregion/coronavirus-new-york-update.html" target="blank">three states reported 1,034 deaths </a>. The number of patients being hospitalized and being put on ventilators in intensive-care units was increasing. Former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo describes how though the number of patients was high, the numbers were far lower than the worst-case scenarios planned. </p>
					<p>“I know it feels like a lifetime,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/video/us/politics/100000007075036/cuomo-coronavirus-update.html?action=click&gtype=vhs&version=vhs-heading&module=vhs&region=title-area&cview=true&t=1" target="_blank">Cuomo said </a>. “It’s been so disruptive. So abrupt. So frightening. So disorienting. But it’s only been 37 days”. </p>
					<p> Facilities in the county of New York had the most cases consistently throughout the dates of March 26 and April 26 of 2020. There were 8835 people admitted to New York county hospitals; 6,499 of them tested positive after being admitted. Despite Kings county (Brooklyn) having 1,041,823 more people than New York county (Manhattan), there were a lot more cases. </p>
					<p> The first months of the pandemic were difficult for the families of frontline workers. Bob Sharipov, a Syracuse University sophomore studying human development and family science from New York City struggled because his dad is a nurse. </p>
					<p>“It was super stressful when Covid first came out,” Sharipov said. “We lived in a three-floor apartment, so he would live on the first floor basically and never see us. We were living like germaphobes essentially.” </p>
					<p>The pandemic forced the world to adopt preventative practices such as working from home, social distancing and masking. </p>

					<h2>Solutions in a Vaccineless society</h2>
					<p>Hospitals were experiencing a shortage of staff and personal protective equipment, P.P.E, while simultaneously seeing a rise in deaths. Maimonides Medical Center saw a surge in cases and experienced the heavy toll of the disease. </p>

					<p> To contrast the bleak sounds of patients coding, the hospital played music each time a coronavirus patient was discharged. “Beautiful Day” by U2 replaced the grim pages, Dr. Patrick Borgen, the hospital's chair of surgery told Business Insider. By the end of April of 2020, Maimonides Medical Center had discharged <a href= "https://www.businessinsider.com/inside-new-york-hospitals-as-they-battled-coronavirus-in-april-2020-5" target="_blank" > 854 coronavirus patients. </a> </p>
					
					<p>In a time without vaccines, hospitals had to carry out clinical trials to try to stop the surge. Maimonides Medical Center entered <a href= "https://www.businessinsider.com/inside-new-york-hospitals-as-they-battled-coronavirus-in-april-2020-5" target="_blank" >400 patients </a> in trials to test coronavirus drugs. The Food and Drug Administration approved administering Remdesivir in critically-ill covid-19 patients. </p>

					<p> "We believe that it has helped some patients but we really believe the real benefit will be giving it earlier in the course of the disease," <a href= "https://www.businessinsider.com/inside-new-york-hospitals-as-they-battled-coronavirus-in-april-2020-5" target="_blank" >Borgen said </a>. "The future of an antiviral like remdesivir will be much much earlier maybe as soon as a test comes back positive,”. </p>

		<h2> Community Impact </h2>
			<p> The emergence of Covid in March of 2020 led to many people working from home. Laura Feliz, a clinical case manager in the outpatient behavioral health clinic at New York-Presbyterian, struggled to adjust to the shift online. </p>

			<p> “Everything changed from one day to another,” Feliz said. “My home became my job, my gym, my place of entertainment. Also my home, my peace right so it’s like all of that now became one. It was really hard to be able to differentiate from the two. My mental health was affected by it also.” </p>

			<p> Feliz, who works in the Pediatric Psychiatry Department, has found that the pandemic has had a serious effect on the children of BIPOC communities. Her hospital location serves many immigrants from the Caribbean and Latin America, many of whom still had to work during the pandemic. </p>

			<p> “The families that we treat have also been greatly affected by covid,” Feliz said. “This is a community that already faces a lot of housing instability, food insecurity. Now you add this. There’s people losing their families. People losing their jobs. Its people having multiple losses within their immediate families. This community is suffering. The BIPOC community continues to suffer.” </p>

		<h2> Fastfoward to 2021 </h2>
			<p> The emergence of variants and a rise in anti-vaccine rhetoric have led to a new wave of Covid, one where New York City is no longer the epicenter. </p>

			<div class="last"> <p> The Omicron variant has high transmissibility and has led to the return of indoor mask mandates in New York. </p>

I focused on the dates between March 26,2020 to April 26,2020. For the charts made through Datawrapper, I used the date where all of the data for the hospitals was available. This ranged from April 22, 2020 to April 26, 2020. <a href=" https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CNWYz8RMjOJSOFsvFTeHcfWtfn5_gvJ_hY8PgiwCkcg/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Here</a> is the data I compressed.</p>
  				<p> I interviewd Syracuse University Sophomore Bob Sharipov initially because I was struggling to get a live source from a hospital. I was able to talk to Laura Feliz, a case manager at New York-Presbyterian Hospital - Columbia center, which is a hospital with a significant amount of cases during the dates I analyzed. </p>
